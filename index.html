        <h1>Welcome to my Favourite Food Recipes website</h1>
        <h3>My name is Yassin Emad. I live in Cairo, Egypt. I am 17 years old. Across my lifetime I loved watching my mom cooking, while helping her in the kitchen. Also, I learnt some recipes for breakfast, launch, snacks, and dinner so that I can cook for myself when I get hungry.</h3>
        <div>
            <p>In this website, I will share with you all my favourite food recipes that I love to make. Starting with breakfast, I love cooking 4 recipes: egg omelette, Shakshouka, Ta'meia, and mashed potatoes.</p>
            <p>For the launch, there are 4 recipes that I often cook for launch or help my mom in cooking them. These 4 dishes are Koshary, Pasta with chicken panne, Burger, and Crepe.</p>
            <p>For the Snack, if I felt hungry after the launch or before it, I sometimes make some delicious snacks to help me forget hunger. I mainly love to cook and eat 4 snacks. These snacks are Yoghuert with buiscits, Fruit salad, Fried Indome noodles, and Fankoush</p>
            <p>For the Dinner, I don't usually have dinner. However, when I feel hungry at night, I cook dinner for me and my family. There are 4 main dinner dishes that I would like to share their recipes with you. These dishes are Fried potatoes widges, Fool with Taheni, Cheese with tomatoes and peppers, and finally stirred fried eggs.</p>
